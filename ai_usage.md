# AI Usage Disclosure

This project made limited and transparent use of AI tools to support documentation and code organization. ChatGPT was used solely for assistance with writing tasks, including improving clarity in the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections, and helping refine the structure of the Jupyter notebook. AI suggestions were also used for non-critical code formatting, such as improving readability or organizing functions.

All analyses, numerical results, model evaluations, and data processing steps were performed by the team. Model training, metric computation, figure generation, and validation were carried out manually using the implemented code. No AI-generated outputs were used without review, and all suggestions were verified for correctness before inclusion.

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and does not contain personal or identifiable information. No clinical or diagnostic conclusions are implied by this work. The full workflow is reproducible through the provided notebook, environment configuration, and repository structure.
